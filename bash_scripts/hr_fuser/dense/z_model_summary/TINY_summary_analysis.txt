This is a detailed breakdown of the object detection model:

- It is a Cascade R-CNN model with HRFormer backbone for high resolution detection.

- The input image size is 384 x 1248 pixels.

- Backbone (HRFuserHRFormerBased):
  - Has 4 stages, each with HRFormer blocks operating at progressively lower resolutions.
  - First stage works on full resolution 384 x 1248.
  - Applies convolutions, batch norms, ReLUs to transform input to desired channels.
  - Uses Bottleneck blocks similar to ResNet architecture.
  - Modules like conv_a, norm_a etc stack operations for each stage.

- Neck (HRFPN):
  - Creates a feature pyramid from backbone output.
  - Has top-down pathways with lateral connections to build multi-scale features.
  - ConvModules apply 3x3 conv, norm, ReLU on each pyramid level.

- RPN Head:
  - Applies 3x3 convs to generate object proposals from backbone features.
  - Predicts proposal classification (cls) and bounding box regression (reg).
  - Contains loss functions for proposal classification and regression.
  - Operates on all FPN levels to output multi-scale proposals.

- ROI Head:
  - Extracts RoI features from each FPN level using RoI Align. 
  - Applies FC layers to classify and regress ROIs into final detections.
  - Cascade ROI heads for progressive refinement of detections.
